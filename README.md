# Owasp-juice-shop-report1
Executive Summary:
This report highlights three key vulnerabilities identified in the OWASP Juice Shop application: Brute Force Attacks, SQL Injection, and Cross-Site Scripting (XSS). These vulnerabilities, if exploited, can compromise the applicationâ€™s security and user data. Below, we outline the risks, evidence of vulnerabilities, and recommended remediation steps.

1. Brute Force Attack

Risk:
Successful exploitation can lead to unauthorized access to user or admin accounts, potentially compromising sensitive information and granting attackers control over the application.

Evidence:
Using a wordlist of usernames and passwords, the attacker was able to successfully log in to an admin account without knowing the password.

Recommendations:

Implement rate limiting to restrict the number of login attempts.

Introduce account lockout mechanisms after a specific number of failed attempts.

Use CAPTCHA to prevent automated login attempts.

Encourage users to use strong, unique passwords.

2. SQL Injection

Risk:
An attacker can exploit this vulnerability to bypass authentication, extract sensitive data, or manipulate the database structure.

Evidence:
By injecting ' OR 1=1 -- into the login form, the attacker was able to bypass authentication and gain access to the application without valid credentials. Union-based SQL injection also revealed database table names.

Recommendations:

Use prepared statements (parameterized queries) to prevent SQL injection.

Validate and sanitize all user inputs rigorously.

Limit database permissions for the application to prevent data modification or extraction.

Regularly test for SQL injection vulnerabilities during development.

3. Cross-Site Scripting (XSS)

Risk:
An attacker can use XSS to steal session cookies, redirect users to malicious websites, or execute unauthorized actions on behalf of users.

Evidence:
By injecting <script>alert('XSS')</script> into the search bar, the malicious script was executed in the browser of any user accessing the manipulated page.

Recommendations:

Sanitize and validate all user inputs to ensure special characters are escaped.

Use Content Security Policy (CSP) headers to restrict the execution of untrusted scripts.

Encode outputs to prevent the browser from interpreting user inputs as executable code.

Implement a web application firewall (WAF) to detect and block XSS payloads.

Conclusion:
The vulnerabilities identified in OWASP Juice Shop highlight common security flaws in web applications. By implementing the recommended remediation steps, the application can significantly enhance its security posture and protect against potential attacks. Regular security audits and adherence to secure coding practices are essential to maintaining a robust defense.
